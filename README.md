# SAT Vocab Game

## About
SAT Vocab Game is a speed typing educational game designed to help learn SAT vocabulary. When the game starts enemy words come down the screen to attack the player. The user must type out the words in order to destroy them. The goal is to survive as long as possible before getting hit. 

There are two game modes: the default mode, and the SAT prep. The default mode is a general list of words that grow in length each round. The SAT prep mode is a list of vocabulary words used in the SAT.
